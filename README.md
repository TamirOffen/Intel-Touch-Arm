# Intel-Touch-Arm
Code written for my side project during my time as an Intel intern(June - August 2018):

    Written in C and C#

    'Robotic_Arm_ver2.ino' is written in C, uploaded to an Arduino.

    'Robotic_Arm_ver1' is written in C#, installed and used by a user on a host machine to communicate with the Touch Arm remotely.
